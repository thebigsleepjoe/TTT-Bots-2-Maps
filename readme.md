# TTT-Bots-2-Maps

This is a repository of bot maps created for the [TTT Bots 2.0](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2) project. These maps consist of reasonably simple geometry, and include navigational meshes designed for use by bots. The bots are mainly designed for use on these maps, but of course are tested on other community maps.

More maps may be provided with time, but this is presented to you with absolutely no guarantees of future support or updates.

## Installation

Download or git clone this repo. Move the maps folder into `/garrysmod/maps/` on your server. Or, place the maps folder into a new folder in your `/garrysmod/addons/` folder.

## License

Same as the [TTT Bots 2.0](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2) repo. As of writing, this is CC-BY-SA-4.0. Basically, you can do whatever you want with this repo as long as you credit the original somewhere if you redistribute.

## Q&A

### Why was this separated from the main repo?

I wanted to de-bloat the original add-on and provide server owners with better ease of use. Some server admins don't want to manually blacklist my maps, and I understand that.

While I don't enjoy making people subscribe to multiple add-ons for the same thing, it's a necessary evil in this situation.

### Why are there multiple versions of the same map name?

Example: `ttt_bots_v4` and `ttt_bots_v5`

This specific example is because v4 is a map I am proud of and is basically a historic (simplified) version of v5: maps focusing on a centralized building in a concrete hellscape, with map geometry creating plenty of opportunities for Traitors to take out Innocents.

This map pack may include maps that suck and/or are hideous, but I don't want to remove them. I want to show my progress and how I, and my bots, have improved over time.

### I don't like X or Y on this map. Can you change it?

If you have a suggestion, feel free to make an issue on this repo. I can't guarantee I'll make the change, but I'll consider it.
